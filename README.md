# molecular-geometry-optimization
This program uses an implementation of the restricted Hartree-Fock method to find energy-minimizing molecular geometries\
Largely based off the process described in Ira Levine's book Quantum Chemistry, and Attila Szabo and Neil Ostlund's book Modern Quantum Chemistry

## How to use

1. In main.py, provide an initial guess for the structure as well as a basis set (some are included already) and call the OptimizeGeometry function
2. Run the program and be patient :)
