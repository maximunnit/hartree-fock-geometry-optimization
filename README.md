# molecular-geometry-optimization
This program uses an implementation of the restricted Hartree-Fock method to find energy-minimizing molecular geometries
Largely based off the process described in Ira Levine's book Quantum Chemistry, and Attila Szabo and Neil Ostlund's book Modern Quantum Chemistry
